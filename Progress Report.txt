Introduction:
For our project, we are aiming to see if weather conditions affect the price of corn in the US, 
specifically looking at the Corn Belt which is located in the Midwest. One of our datasets comes 
from USDA shows the production of corn from 00'-24'. We used this dataset to determine the top 
producers within the US. Following that we have a US Weather dataset from Kaggle that shows the 
daily weather condtions all over the Untied States from 92'-21'. We used this data to determine 
the weather conditions in the Corn Belt which is the area we are observing. Lastly, we had a dataset 
that covered the price of corn and it's fluctuations. Some of our visualizations include maps of corn 
and weather data as well as charts showing weather and price changes. 

Changes:
For the most part, we haven't changed much with our project. We are still focusing on corn and the prices with 
relation to weather. We added a few data sets like the US_GeoCode in order to find longitude and lattitude.
Initally we found a data set that contained corn futures. After cleaning it and processing it we discovered that
it onyl contains ranges of prices instead of actual prices. This is importnat because if a price changes throughout the
market day but returns to the original price, the range will be 0. We ended up finding a new dataset that we plan to use in the future
that contains highs and lows for each market day. 

Hypothesis:
For our hypothesis test we simply wanted to see if the 2024 avg. price of corn was greater than the 2000 avg. price. 
Our null hypothesis was that the 2024 price is less than or equal to the 2000 price, and our alternative was that
the 2024 price is greater than the 2000 price. The test resulted in a T-statistic of 30.88
and a P-value of 5.27e-18. This value is extremly low compared to the aplha level of .05. As a reuslt we reject the null
hypothesis, conlcuding that the price of corn in 2024 is greater than in 2000. 



What is the hardest part of the project that you’ve encountered so far?
    - The harderst part so far of the project has been finding data and deciding which 
    time intervals to use (days,months, years).
What are your initial insights?
    A few insights that we have seen so far are that the major corn producers in the 
    United States are located in the Midwest, which includes the states Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota.
    In addition, 
Are there any concrete results you can show at this point? If not, why not?

Going forward, what are the current biggest problems you’re facing?

Do you think you are on track with your project? If not, what parts do you need to
dedicate more time to?

Given your initial exploration of the data, is it worth proceeding with your project,
why? If not, how are you going to change your project and why do you think it’s
better than your current results
